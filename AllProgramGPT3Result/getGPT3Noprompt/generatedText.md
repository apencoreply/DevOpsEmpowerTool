Based on the provided code and JMeter results, here are some suggestions to improve the snippet:

1. Error Handling: 
   - The code currently handles the `CosmosException` type and returns a NotFoundResult in case of a 404 error. However, it would be beneficial to handle other types of exceptions as well and provide appropriate responses.
   - You can consider adding more specific exception handling to provide better error messages and debug information to the logs.

2. Environment Variable Usage:
   - In the current code, the environment variables are being accessed directly using `Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable`. It would be better to encapsulate this logic in a separate class or method to improve code maintainability and testability.
   - Consider using a configuration management library or framework, such as `IConfiguration`, to manage environment variables and other configuration settings.

3. Dependency Injection:
   - For improved testability and decoupling, it would be beneficial to use dependency injection to provide dependencies like `ILogger` and `CosmosClient`.
   - Refactor the `Run` method to receive these dependencies through constructor injection.

4. Logging:
   - The code currently logs errors using `log.LogError`. It would be helpful to provide more detailed information about the specific error that occurred.
   - Consider logging additional information such as the request ID, timestamps, and any relevant request details to aid in debugging.

5. Performance and Scalability:
   - Currently, the code creates a new instance of `CosmosClient` and `Container` for each request. This can impact performance and resource consumption.
   - Consider initializing the `CosmosClient` and `cosmosContainer` objects outside the function or using a singleton pattern to reuse the same instance across multiple requests.

These are just some general suggestions to improve the code based on the provided snippet and JMeter results. It's important to thoroughly analyze and understand the specific requirements and constraints of your application to make further enhancements.
