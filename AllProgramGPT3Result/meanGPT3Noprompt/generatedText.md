Based on the provided code and JTL results, there are a few areas where you can optimize and improve the code:

1. Caching the Cosmos DB container: Instead of creating a new instance of `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Container` for every request, you can cache the container instance to improve performance. This can be done by making the container a static field or using a caching mechanism like `MemoryCache` to store and retrieve the container.

2. Async improvements: The code can benefit from using `Task.WhenAll` to execute multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently. In the current code, the queries to Cosmos DB are executed one by one, which can be improved by parallelizing the requests.

3. Bulk operations: If the number of retrieved documents is large and the average elevation is calculated for a specific country, consider using bulk operations instead of individual operations for better performance. For example, you can retrieve all documents for the given country in a single query and perform the necessary calculations on the client-side.

4. Connection to Cosmos DB: Maintaining a long-lived connection to Cosmos DB can improve performance by reducing the overhead of establishing a connection for each request. You can consider using a singleton pattern or a connection pooling mechanism to reuse connections.

5. Error handling and logging: The current error handling and logging in the code could be improved for better troubleshooting. Consider providing more specific error messages and logging the actual exception details to help identify and resolve any issues.

6. Performance testing and optimization: Based on the JTL results, it would be beneficial to perform performance testing on the code to identify any bottlenecks or areas for optimization. You can use JMeter or similar tools to simulate concurrent requests and measure the response times and throughput of the function.

7. Code organization: Consider organizing the code into separate classes and files based on their responsibilities. For example, you can have a separate class for Cosmos DB operations, models, and error handling.

By implementing these improvements, you can enhance the performance and efficiency of the code.
